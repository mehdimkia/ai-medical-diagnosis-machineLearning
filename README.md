## 📖 Course overview

This repository contains my solutions for the **AI for Medical Diagnosis** course on Coursera taught by Dr. Andrew Ng & team.  
Across **three weeks** you’ll find Jupyter notebooks and supporting files exploring:

- **Week 1:** Disease detection with computer vision (e.g., X-ray classification)  
- **Week 2:** Evaluation of diagnostic models (ROC, sensitivity, specificity)  
- **Week 3:** Advanced models: U-Net segmentation, custom loss functions

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Clone** this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehdimkia/ai-medical-diagnosis-machineLearning.git
   cd ai-medical-diagnosis-machineLearning
   ```
2. **Create & activate** a virtual environment  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
   ```
3. **Install** dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Launch** Jupyter Lab  
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
5. Open any notebook under `Week 1/`, `Week 2/` or `Week 3/` and run cells top-to-bottom.
